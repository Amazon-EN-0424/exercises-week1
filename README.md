### Exercise for Week 1: Coffee Time! â˜•ðŸŒŸ

#### Objective:
Today, you'll get your hands on basic Java concepts like data types, string methods, and conditionals through a fun and simple coffee-themed exercise.

#### Background:
Imagine you're helping to program a digital display for a coffee shop. This display shows different messages based on the coffee type.

#### Task:
You will create a simple Java program that prints a message for each type of coffee. This will help you understand how to use strings and conditionals.

#### Requirements:
1. **Data Types**: Use the `String` data type to store types of coffee.
2. **String Methods**: Use string methods to manipulate and display text.
3. **Conditionals**: Use if-else statements to decide what message to print based on the coffee type.

#### Instructions:
1. **Create a variable to store the type of coffee**. Assume the coffee type is "Latte" for now.
2. **Use an if-else statement to check the type of coffee**:
   - If it's "Espresso", print a message saying it's strong.
   - If it's "Americano", print a message noting it's a classic choice.
   - If it's "Latte", print a message about it being creamy and delicious.


#### Tasks:
- Try changing the `coffeeType` variable to different options and see what messages print.
- Think about how you might use string methods like `toLowerCase()` or `toUpperCase()` to make the input more flexible.



### Exercise 2: Coffee Strength Calculator
#### Objective:
Learn to use arithmetic operators to calculate the strength of the coffee based on user preferences.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define variables for coffee base (amount of coffee in grams) and water ratio.**
2. **Calculate the strength by dividing the coffee base by the water ratio.**
3. **Print out the strength with a suitable message.**



### Exercise 3: Coffee Temperature Warning
#### Objective:
Use relational operators to warn the user if the coffee might be too hot to drink immediately.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define a variable for the temperature of the coffee.**
2. **Use an if-else statement to check if the temperature is above a certain threshold and warn the user.**



### Exercise 4: Coffee Price Estimator
#### Objective:
Learn to use the addition and multiplication operators to estimate the price of a coffee order.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define variables for the number of coffees ordered and the price per cup.**
2. **Calculate the total cost and print it.**



#### Exercise 5: Coffee Type Counter
#### Objective:
Learn to use a `for` loop to iterate through an array of coffee orders and count how many of each type there are.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define an array of strings where each element is a type of coffee ordered by customers.**
2. **Use a `for` loop to iterate through the array and count the number of each type of coffee.**
3. **Print the counts for Espresso, Latte, and Americano.**

#### Exercise 6: Coffee Replenish Reminder
#### Objective:
Use a `while` loop to simulate checking a coffee machineâ€™s stock and remind to replenish if stock goes below a certain threshold.

#### Instructions:
1. **Start with a certain number of coffee pods.**
2. **Use a `while` loop to decrease the number of coffee pods as they are used, one at a time.**
3. **Print a reminder to replenish the pods when only 2 remain.**

#### Exercise 7: Coffee Menu Printer
#### Objective:
Demonstrate a `do-while` loop by printing each type of coffee until the end of a list is reached.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define an array of coffee types like Espresso, Americano, Latte, and Cappuccino.**
2. **Use a `do-while` loop to print each type until you've gone through the list.**

#### Exercise 8: Coffee Flavor Enhancer
#### Objective:
Learn to use a `for-each` loop to iterate through an array of coffee additives and print a message for each.

#### Instructions:
1. **Define an array of additives such as "vanilla", "caramel", "cinnamon".**
2. **Use a `for-each` loop to iterate through the array and suggest adding each to a coffee to enhance the flavor.**
